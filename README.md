## `Project Idea`

Your turn is a experimental social media that allows users to draw a number and post for a chance at getting their post shown on the main page. A number 0-1000 is attached to every post, the top 3 users with the highest number get their post featured. The goal is to get users to post daily whether it's to try to start a conversation or to advertise their business.

## `User Stories`

As a user:
- I want to be able to create an account
- I want to be able to sign into an account
- I want to be able to sign out of an account
- I want to be able to draw a number
- I want to be able to see what place I got
- I want to be able to create a post
- I want to be able to edit a post
- I want to be able to delete a post
